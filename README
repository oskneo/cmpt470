Readme
Member: Francesco Zhang, Daniel Peng, Agassi

Introduction:
	
	ASP.NET is an open source web development framework designed by Microsoft in 1992 to create dynamic web pages.  The version we are using is Asp.net Core 2.14. It can be used to implement with many frontend libraries and different types of database. We will not demonstrate all of them. Here is a list of development models and functions we will demonstrate.

Models and Functions:

Asp.net Web Page
Asp.net MVC5(Model, View, Controller) Framework:
·        Account System (Implemented by the framework)
·        Improved account system
·        Custom role for account and admin page for admin role.
·        By entering the key of admin role "000000", user can register as an admin. 
·        Razor syntax(view)
·        The communication between server and client(controller)
·        Database initiate and migration(model)
·        The page to add data and show data
Asp.net MVC with React
Asp.net Signal IR

Deplyment:
Our deployment only can show one type of model at the same time.
And it is not a hot workstation.
